# Spring-Cleaning
# First Step: 
Create a new database
shirts_db

# Second Step:
Create a new table
shirts

# Third Step:
Populate the table with the following data

shirt_id, article, color, shirt_size, last_worn
1	t-shirt	white	S	10
2	t-shirt	green	S	200
3	polo shirt	black	M	10
4	tank top	blue	S	50
5	t-shirt	pink	S	0
6	polo shirt	red	M	5
7	tank top	white	S	200
8	tank top	blue	M	15

# Below are some of the exercises you will have to complete for this project:
1. Get all that data in there with a single line
2. Add a new shirt, purple polo shirt, size M last worn 50 days ago
3. SELECT all shirts but only print out article and color
4. SELECT all medium shirts and print out everything but shirt_id
5. Update all polo shirts Change their size to L
6. Update the shirt last worn 15 days ago change last_worn to zero ('0')
7. Update all white shirts and change size to 'XS' and color to 'off white'
8. Delete all old shirts that were last worn 200 days ago
9. Delete all tank tops. Your tastes have changed...
10. Delete all shirts. You are doing some major spring cleaning!
11. Drop the entire shirts table. Scraping everything... you must be rich or something!

Once you are done with your queries, please create a git repo and store your queries in an .SQL file, 
separating each section with comments and outlining each step including the first 3 steps above.
